# Labor Link

The populace has encountered difficulties in getting blue-collar laborers for daily household chores or any form of service.Numerous applications and agencies provide such laborers on demand. Nonetheless, these platforms confront several challenges, including a lack of worker authentication in certain instances, and the absence of temporary scheduling options. The proposed system delineated in this paper seeks to mitigate these shortcomings by devising an application that integrates worker authentication through facial recognition. Furthermore, the application can be
operated using voice commands, and it encompasses temporary scheduling. Moreover, the application incorporates a content-based recommendation system and sentiment analysis functionality. To bolster the development of this system, we have amassed a sample database from blue-collar workers in Mumbai.
